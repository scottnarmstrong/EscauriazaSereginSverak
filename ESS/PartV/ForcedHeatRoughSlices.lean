# The slicewise weak gradient of the rough forced heat response

Along a smooth approximation whose responses converge in the weighted `L¹`
sense and whose spatial gradients converge in `L²(Q_τ)`, a fast subsequence
converges on almost every time slice; passing the classical slice identities to
the limit shows that for almost every time the limit gradient is the weak
spatial gradient of the slice of the rough response, as required by the
finite-energy class of `prop:pv-local-solution`.
